## Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This repository contains four separate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects, each performed on a unique dataset. The analyses focus on understanding the data distribution, identifying patterns and trends, detecting anomalies, and summarizing key insights through visualizations and statistical summaries.

# Key Highlights:
Comprehensive EDA for diverse datasets covering different domains

Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature exploration

Visualizations including histograms, box plots, violin plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps

Insights to guide further data modeling and decision making

This collection is ideal for anyone looking to understand the fundamental steps and techniques involved in initial data exploration.
